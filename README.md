# Covid-Stats 📈

## Project Overview 📝
This is a class project that I coded with the intention of organizing COVID-19 statistics. 
In this project, I specifically used a CSV file that contained 2021 COVID-19 statistics in the USA. 

## Key Contributions ⭐
- Designed sorting algorithms for ordering states based on cases and deaths
- Implemented data parsing and processing techniques to extract state-specific information from a CSV file
- Calculated average cases and deaths across states, providing valuable insights into the pandemic's impact.

## Achievements ✅
- Successfully loaded and processed COVID-19 data from an external source.
- Implemented sorting algorithms to display states with the highest and lowest cases and deaths.
- Calculated and displayed average cases and deaths for an informative overview.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- Java
- CSV data parsing
- Data sorting algorithms.
